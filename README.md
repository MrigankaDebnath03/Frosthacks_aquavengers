# 💧 Drought Prediction using SARIMA

## 🌟 Inspiration  
We were inspired by the challenge of finding innovative solutions to address **water scarcity** using **artificial intelligence (AI)**. Our goal was to create a project that helps people understand the current and future state of water availability in their region, while also providing useful resources, conservation tips, and raising awareness about the **causes and effects of water scarcity**.  

---

## 🚀 What it does  
Our project predicts **drought and water scarcity** across different regions of **India**, using a **Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA)** model.  

🔹 The model considers:  
- Historical **rainfall** data  
- **Temperature** trends  
- **Vegetation index (NDVI)**  

From these, it forecasts future values and assigns:  
- **Drought severity index**  
- **Water scarcity levels**  

✨ Features include:  
- Interactive **map visualization**  
- **Resources page** with water-saving tips  
- **Search function** to check water status in regions  
- **Social media integration**  
- Engaging **data-driven graphics**  

---

## 🛠️ How we built it  
We combined multiple technologies:  

- **Satellite imaging** (NASA Earth Observations for NDVI)  
- **Government & global datasets** (World Bank, WRI)  
- **Machine Learning** (SARIMA, regression & classification)  
- **Web application**: Built using **Streamlit**  
- **Visualization tools**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Plotly, Folium  

---

## ⚡ Challenges we ran into  
- Finding reliable and updated datasets  
- Processing & aligning **satellite images** with geographic coordinates  
- Selecting and tuning the right **ML models**  
- Designing an intuitive **web app interface**  
- Managing **time, workload, and collaboration** within the team  

---

## 🏆 Accomplishments we’re proud of  
- Built a reliable **SARIMA-based model** for drought forecasting  
- Developed a **user-friendly web app** with interactive features  
- Leveraged **satellite imaging + data visualization** for impactful graphics  
- Gained valuable **skills in ML, satellite data, and web development**  

---

## 📚 What we learned  
- Practical experience with **satellite imagery** & ML models  
- Building **end-to-end web apps** with Streamlit  
- Deep insights into **water scarcity causes, effects, and solutions**  
- Importance of **water conservation** and its global impact  

---

## 🔮 What’s next for *Drought Prediction using SARIMA*  
- Integrating more variables: **soil moisture, groundwater, evapotranspiration**  
- Expanding scope to **other regions & countries**  
- Adding new web app features:  
  - Personalized **dashboard**  
  - **Feedback system**  
  - **Gamification elements**  
- Collaborating with users & stakeholders for **greater impact**
